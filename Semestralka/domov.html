            <h3>What is Dungeons & Dragons ?</h3>
            <p class="text"> Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)
                is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally
                designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was first
                published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR).
                It has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro)
                since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation
                of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D&D's
                publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games
                and the role-playing game industry, and also deeply influenced video games,
                especially the role-playing video game genre. </p>

            <h3>How to play ?</h3>
            <p class="text"> Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet open-ended role-playing game.
                It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically,
                one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character
                , representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs)
                are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes
                to the success of the whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character
                and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation
                of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic,
                basic mathematics and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure,
                and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a "campaign". </p>

            <h3>Adventures and Campaigns </h3>
            <p class="text"> Main articles: Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons) and Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings
                A Dungeon Master's notebook with a custom design adventure
                A typical Dungeons & Dragons game consists of an "adventure",
                which is roughly equivalent to a single story. The DM can either design
                an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as "modules")
                that have been published throughout the history of Dungeons & Dragons. Published adventures typically include a background story,
                illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled
                "Temple of the Frog" was included in the Blackmoor rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone D&D module published by TSR was 1978's
                Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, written by Gygax.
                A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a "campaign".
                The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet
                or an entire fictional universe, are referred to as "campaign settings" or "world".
                D&D settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.
                Popular commercially published campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons include Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms,
                Mystara, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Dark Sun, Planescape, Birthright, and Eberron.
                In addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created.
                The first, based on Stranger Things, was released in May 2019. A campaign based on the Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons comic
                book series was later released in November 2019.
                Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings. </p>

                <h3>Miniature figures</h3>
                <p class="text"> The wargames from which Dungeons & Dragons evolved used miniature figures to
                    represent combatants. D&D initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar
                    to its direct precursors. The original D&D set of 1974 required the use of the Chainmail m
                    iniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, co
                    mbat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, a
                    lthough some players continued to use them as a visual reference.
                    In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for Dungeons
                    & Dragons and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figur
                    es include Grenadier Miniatures (1980–1983),Citadel Miniatures (1984–1986), Ral Partha,and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25 mm scale.
                    Periodically, Dungeons & Dragons has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rule
                    s systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as Battlesystem (1985 a
                    nd 1989) and a new edition of Chainmail (2001)] provided rule systems to handle battles between
                    armies by using miniatures. </p>

                <h3>Original Game</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    The original Dungeons & Dragons, now referred to as OD&D,
                    was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. With
                    a very limited production budget of only $2000—with only $100
                    budgeted for artwork. It was amateurish in production
                    and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly
                    in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience
                    of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in
                    the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.
                    This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions,
                    such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),
                    as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines. </p>
